				Welcome to the Games Arena! Which is my first full stack application
				made using React.js for the Front-end and Express and Node.js in the
				Back-end. The purpose of this application is to have reviews of various
				board games which allows you to vote and commment on reviews. It also
				has a login feature which allows you to login in and log out with a
				username. This was done while i was at Northcoders. Which is a Company
				who teach people to find their way in the Software Developement
				industry. I can say with all my heart that i have loved every minute of
				my time at Northcoders, even though it was very challenging as it was my
				first time learning to code. This application will be an ongoing project
				as i improve my skills and i will be implementing more features and
				functionality. Hope you enjoy it!{' '}
